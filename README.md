# Todo_List_App
The To-Do List is a simple web app that lets users add, manage, and remove tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it helps practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and user input. The app provides a clean interface, real-time task updates, and a hands-on way to learn core front-end skills.
